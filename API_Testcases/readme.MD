This is one of the coding examples that I've written recently, it is a take home coding 
exercise that was part of the interview process from another company. I haven't got the chance to 
complete the assignment but I've set up a framework that included code that is reusable, flexible, 
modular, and functionally stable. This framework was designed for the website http://www.demoblaze.com, and 
the testing objective is to use rest api testing for testing payload from various resources, and UI testing to validate functionality for navigation and submitting selected items to the cart for transaction processing.
